# CISC 2200 Data Structures Labs & Final Project

This repository contains all five labs and the final project that I have worked on in relation Data Structures.

## Labs & Projects
- Lab 1
  - This lab contains a program that implements an unsorted list using arrays. 
- Lab 2
  - This lab contains a program that implements both a sorted and unsorted list using arrays.
- Lab 3
  - This lab contains a program that verifies if a given string that has parenthesis, brackets, and braces is balanced.
- Lab 4
  - This lab contains a program that implements a binary search tree (BST).
- Lab 5
  - This lab contains a program that implements a directed weighted graph using an array and a hash table via the use of an unordered map.
- Project
  - This project contains a program that converts infix to postfix notation and evaluates the expression that the user inputs into the program.
