# Lab 3 Parenthesis Balancing Checker

This program checks whether a given string containing parenthesis, brackets, and braces is balanced. A balanced string ensures that:
- Every opening symbol (`(`, `[`, `{`) has a corresponding and properly placed closing symbol (`)`, `]`, `}`).
- Symbols are nested correctly.

## Features

- **Input Validation:**
  - Ensures valid matching for all combinations of parentheses, brackets, and braces.
  - Detects unbalanced or unmatched symbols.
- **Output Messages:**
  - Indicates whether the input string is balanced or unbalanced.
